# Manual JWT Implementationü§ìüíªüîí


This project demonstrates the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) manually, providing you with more control and flexibility over the JWT generation and validation process.

## Why Use Manual JWT?üîí

There are several scenarios where implementing manual JWT can be advantageous, such as:

- Needing fine-grained control over JWT creation and validation.
- Integrating JWT with legacy systems.
- Customizing JWT claims to fit specific application requirements.

## How to Implement Manual JWT‚å®Ô∏è

Follow these steps to implement manual JWT in your project:

1. **Create UserClaims Class:** Define a `UserClaims` class to represent the claims about the user, such as their name, email address, and role. This class will be used when generating JWT tokens.

2. **Create JwtService Class:** Build a `JwtService` class responsible for generating and validating JWT tokens. This class should include methods for token creation and validation.

3. **Generate JWT Token:** When a user authenticates, call the appropriate method in your `JwtService` class to generate a JWT token with the desired claims.

4. **Set JWT Token:** Store the generated JWT token in a cookie or include it in the HTTP headers of subsequent requests. Ensure proper security measures are in place, such as using secure cookies and secure headers.

5. **Validate JWT Token:** On every incoming request, validate the JWT token by using the `JwtService` class to check the token's authenticity and expiration date.

6. **Authorize Access:** Based on the claims present in the JWT token, implement access control logic to determine whether the user is authorized to access specific resources.

## Tips for Implementing Manual JWT Securely ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è

Here are some best practices to ensure the security of your manual JWT implementation:

- Use a strong and secret security key for signing JWT tokens.
- Set a reasonably **short expiration time** for JWT tokens to minimize their exposure.
- Implement a mechanism to invalidate JWT tokens if they are compromised, such as token revocation lists.

## Example Code

```python
# Example code snippets

# UserClaims class
class UserClaims:
    def __init__(self, user_id, username, role):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.username = username
        self.role = role

# JwtService class
class JwtService:
    def __init__(self, secret_key):
        self.secret_key = secret_key

    def generate_token(self, user_claims):
        # Implement JWT token generation here

    def validate_token(self, token):
        # Implement JWT token validation here
